This Dockerfile extends the Oracle WebLogic image built under 1221-domain with tag name '1221-domain'

WLST Offline script are used during Docker image build phase to deploy the 

- JDBC Data Source (Derby database information is picked up from the datasource.properties file)
- JMS artifacts (JMS Server, Queue etc). 

# How to build and run
First make sure you have built sample image inside **1221-domain**. Now to build this sample, run:

        $ docker build -t 1221-domain-with-resources .

To start the Admin Server with the application automatically deployed, run:

        $ docker run -d -p 8001:8001 1221-domain-with-resources

You should now be able to see the Data Source and the JMS components

Tuxedo on Docker
===============
Sample Docker configurations to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. This project includes  [samples](samples/) for Tuxedo 12.1.3 based on Oracle Linux.

The certification of Tuxedo on Docker does not require the use of any file presented in this repository. Customers and users are welcome to use them as starters, and customize/tweak, or create from scratch new scripts and Dockerfiles.

## How to build and run
This folder contains the information and examples of how to use [Tuxedo](http://oracle.com/tuxedo) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## To use
1. Into an empty directory:
  1. Download the Tuxedo 12.1.3 Linux 64 bit installer from OTN
  2. Download all the files from this github directory
  3. Optionally download the latest Tuxedo rolling patch from My Oracle Support
2. cd dockerfiles
3. Execute 'bash buildDockerImage.sh'

You should end up with a docker image tagged oracle/tuxedo:version

You can then start the image in a new container with:  `docker run -i -t oracle/tuxedo:version /bin/bash`
which will put you into the container with a bash prompt.  If you want to test the new container, simply execute the `simpapp_runme.sh` in an empty
directory and the script will build and run the Tuxedo simpapp application.
